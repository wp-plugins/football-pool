#. Description of the plugin/theme
msgid ""
"This plugin adds a football pool for the 2012 European Champioship to your "
"blog. Logged in users of your blog can predict outcomes of matches and earn "
"extra points with bonus questions. View scores and charts of the pool "
"contenders. Use your own theme (or use the skin for Simply Works Core that "
"is included in the assets folder) and add the widgets that come with this "
"plugin. The plugin installs some custom tables in the database with match "
"information for the 2012 UEFA championship, but can be easily manipulated "
"with the match info for other championships (change the data/data.txt file "
"for this). <strong>Please note that deactivating this plugin also destroys "
"all your pool data</strong> (predictions, scores and comments on pages that "
"this plugin created). So if you want to keep those, make sure you have a "
"back-up of the database."
