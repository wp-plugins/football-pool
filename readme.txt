This plugin adds a fantasy sports pool to your blog. Play against other users, predict outcomes of matches and earn points.

== Description ==
Logged in users of your blog can predict outcomes of matches and earn extra points with bonus questions. Every player can view scores and charts of the other pool contenders.

This plugin installs some custom tables in the database and ships with match information for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, but it can be easily manipulated with the match info for other championships or sports. Please note that deactivating this plugin may also delete all the plugin's data from the database, please check the 'keep data on uninstall' option on the settings page (it is set by default since version 2.3.1).

I originally coded this pool in PHP as a standalone site for the UEFA 2000 championship and rewrote the damn thing several times for every European Championship and World Cup since. Every year I added new features. In 2012 I decided to transform it into a WordPress plugin. I hope you like it.

A special thank you to all the translators that found time to translate the many labels in this plugin. And thanks to all the users that reported bugs.

**Features**

* Users can predict match outcomes.
* Automatic calculation of the pool ranking. Or define your own custom ranking for a group of matches.
* You can add bonus questions for extra fun (single answer and multiple choice).
* Add your own teams and match info to use the plugin for another (national) competition.
* Import or export the game schedule.
* Automatic calculation of championship standing.
* Configurable scoring options.
* Use the built in pages and/or shortcodes to add the pool to your blog.
* Use different leagues for your users (optional).
* Users have charts where their scores are plotted. And they can compare themselves to other players. (Only available if Highcharts chart API is downloaded seperately, see Help for details).
* Several widgets and shortcodes to display info from the championship or the pool.
* Extra info pages for venues and teams.
* Extensible via filters and actions (see help page in the admin).

== Installation ==
**Important:** If you want to use a translated version of the pool, make sure you set the correct <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language">WPLANG</a>. To use your own custom translation see the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/football-pool/faq/">FAQ</a> for more information on translating the plugin.

1. Download `football-pool.zip` from the plugin panel or unzip the file and upload the folder `football-pool` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` panel in WordPress
3. Edit the plugin configuration via the admin menu
4. Optional: add the pages for the pool to your menu, or use some other method to link to the pages
5. Optional: add the "Football pool" widgets to your sidebar
6. Optional: add bonus questions
7. Optional: 'upgrade' existing users in your blog to pool players
8. Optional: make the `upload` directory in the plugin folder writable (if you want to use the import function)
9. If you want to use the charts feature please download the Highcharts API (http://www.highcharts.com/download) and put the `highcharts.js` file in the following path: `/wp-content/plugins/highcharts-js/highcharts.js`

After the pool has been set up, all you have to do is monitor the users that subscribe and fill in the right scores for the matches and the right answers for the bonus questions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Wow, there are a lot of options. Do I need to change them? =
You can, but it's not necessary. With default settings the plugin should be fine. You can play around with the options before you start the pool.

= Do you have a theme that I can use with the plugin? =
No. I'm not a designer, so I don't have the skills to make one.

= I installed the plugin, but there are no matches. What happened? =
Since version 2.0.0 the plugin does not add the matches on install. But it does contain an example match schedule as an exported csv file. Go to the Matches admin page and do an import of a schedule file ("Bulk change match schedule").

= Do I need the "Predictions" page? =
Yes and no. The plugin needs this page to display predictions of users. So don't delete it. But you can remove it from your menu (WordPress Admin &raquo; Appearance &raquo; Menus).
Some themes or WordPress configurations automatically put all top level pages in the navigation. See information from the theme maker on how to make a custom menu or how to exclude pages from the menu.

= I want to use the plugin for a national competition. Is that possible? =
Yes. There are two ways to do this: 
1. Upload a game schedule in the admin. Make sure you understand the required format; you can find an example in the upload folder.
2. Use the admin screens to edit the teams, groups, match types, matches, etc.

And, of course, choose a theme or make one yourself that fits your competition or blog.

= The plugin won't calculate the ranking =
If you experience problems with the calculation of the ranking, you may wanna try the old calculation method. To enable the old method add the following line to your `wp-config.php` file: `define( 'FOOTBALLPOOL_RANKING_CALCULATION_NOAJAX', true );`. 
If you have any information that may help me solve your problem (e.g. the error log), please send the information to wordpressfootballpool [at] gmail [dot] com.

= The charts are gone! What happened? =
I had to remove the required library because of WordPress plugin license policies. If you want to enable the charts then see the Help page in the WordPress admin for details on how to install the required library.

= I don't see my blog users as players of the pool. =
Go to the WordPress Admin &raquo; Football Pool &raquo; Users screen and check if these users are added in a league (if you are using leagues). Newly registered users are automatically added, but users that allready existed in your blog have to be updated in the admin screen. In order to make them a player in the pool add them to a league and save. If you delete a league, then the users in that league must be placed in another league.
If you're not using leagues, then make sure the users are not removed from the pool via the Users screen.

= Is there a translation available? =
See the 'Other notes' section for the available languages (and their translators). The translations are in the 'languages' dir. To use translations, change the WPLANG constant in the wp-config.php to the right language code (e.g. "nl_NL").

If you want to make your own translation, you can use the pot-file that is included in the 	`languages` directory or make a copy of one of the `football-pool-*locale*.po` files in the `languages` directory and use an editor like Poedit (http://www.poedit.net/) to create the mo-file. The default content for the rules page is in the `rules-page-content-*locale*.txt` file (e.g. `rules-page-content-nl_NL.txt`).
If you've made your own translation and mail it to me, I'll add it to the plugin and give you the credits.
You can put your custom translation files in the plugin-dir, but be careful they don't get overwritten with an update of the plugin. So, according to <a href="http://www.geertdedeckere.be/article/loading-wordpress-language-files-the-right-way">this site</a> (and the codex) it's better to put the translation file in a subfolder (named 'football-pool') of the `WP_LANG_DIR`. I support the fallback mechanism that is described on that site in my plugin.

Make sure you name the mo-file right: **football-pool-aa_BB.mo** (where aa_BB is your language code)

= I installed the plugin, but it does not look like your screenshots. =
That's correct. The plugin has some basic styling, but it will not change your entire blog. You will have to fit the styling to your site yourself. Change your theme to overwrite/change the style of the plugin, or use a plugin to add extra custom stylesheets. Please don't change the css in the plugin folder; if you update the plugin, all your hard work will be gone.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 2.4.0 =
After upgrading to version 2.4.0 a full calculation is needed. Please back up your database before updating!

= 2.3.0 =
Please back up your database before updating! If you made changes to the plugin, also make a backup of your changes.

= 2.2.0 =
Please back up your database before updating! 
Plugin styling of widgets has changed to be a little less 'dominant' over the styling of your theme.

= 2.1.3 =
Highcharts API is moved to a directory outside the plugin's directory so future upgrading won't break your site.

= 2.1.1 =
Shortcodes have changed in this version. Old shortcodes are still supported but are deprecated. Please update your content.

= 2.0.0 =
Default language is now English. Change de `WPLANG` constant if you want to use another language. If you're upgrading from a version prior to v1.3 you get a warning that the column `max_answers` already exists. That's fine, the plugin will work and you won't get the warning again. 

= 1.4.5 =
Highcharts API was removed from the plugin. See the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/football-pool/faq/">FAQ</a> for details.

== Changelog ==

= 2.4.3 =
* Added 'auto set' function to bonus questions. This makes it easier for admins when rewarding points for multiple choice questions with a fixed set of answers a user can choose from.
* Added a filter that adds the team name, stadium name or group name to the corresponding page's title tag.
* Added weighted average points as an option for the [fp-league-info] shortcode.
* Updated Dutch translation.
* Added Swedish translation.
* Bug fix: when all bonus questions are linked to a match, the pool page still showed the title for a question form beneath the matches form.

= 2.4.2 =
* Some themes don't show the cog icon for the chart settings in the title of the page. Added shortcode [fp-chart-settings] that can be used to display the cog icon somewhere in the text. The shortcode only works for the statistics page.
* Added `FOOTBALLPOOL_CHANGE_STATS_TITLE` constant that can be set to `false` in the wp-config file to disable the cog icon in the page title (in case something goes wrong in your theme).
* Removed 'show avatar' option. I'm in the midst of changing some parts of the plugin to use HTML templates for the display of data. The avatar can already be added to the ranking table (see help page for details); other parts of the plugin will follow later.
* Moved the plugin screenshots from the plugin's zip to the svn assets folder (they're only needed for the wordpress.org site).
* Bug fix: matches disappeared when using a match sorting method that included the match type (thanks Kevin for reporting the problem and allowing me to do some bug tracking on your site).
* Bug fix: shortcode pop-up in the WP admin always included a group ID for the [fp-matches] shortcode.
* Bug fix: calculation of number of predictions went wrong for custom rankings with only bonus questions (thanks Daniel for reporting the bug).
* Bug fix: undefined index 'league_id' on the ranking page (thanks sillery4ever for reporting the bug).
* Bug fix: match schedule was wrong for the quarter finals. The matches were imported sorted on date causing the match numbers to not match correctly for the semi-finals (e.g. winner match 57). (thanks Bobby Groenen for reporting the bug).
* Bug fix: get_page_link() caused a notice when plugin pages are deleted from the database.
* Bug fix: typo in match template; match ID and form ID weren't replaced with the params.

= 2.4.1 =

* Bug fix: user predictions were shown before the match stop time had passed (thanks latinosamorir for reporting the bug).

= 2.4.0 =
* **Important!** Changes were made in the scorehistory table. If you're upgrading from a previous version please do a full calculation after the upgrade.

* Removed `user_label` functionality (the meta key is still in the database if you want to use it). User name display can now be altered via the `footballpool_user_info_display_name` filter.
* Removed 'number of predictions' as an option for the ranking table. This functionality is now available as a template parameter in the new template structure. See the help page under the Actions and Filters section if you want the number of predictions back.

= 2.2.2 =
* Bug fix: WP nonce not set on delete and edit link in matches admin screen (thanks ipixelestudio for reporting this).

* Added an extra warning for the administrator of the blog in the Plugins and Updates pages in the WordPress admin when the plugin has the charts enabled but the Highcharts API is missing.

= 2.1.2 =

= 2.1.1 =

* Added culture selection to csv file list (on import screen) and support for meta information in the csv file.
* Added extra label that can be added to a username via the User Admin screen. Usable for an extra status (e.g. "winner 2012") or to show cumulative scores from other years (e.g. "1057 points"). The label (if not empty) is added behind a user's name on the ranking page and in the list generated by the ranking shortcode. A CSS class that can be styled to your liking is added to the label.
* Added possibility to hide match types from the website. Usefull for competitions with large amounts of matches where you don't want to show every match all the time. Invisible match types are not shown on the website (matches page and prediction page) and in the admin for matches, but are still calculated for the scores.
* Added extra info fields for venues and teams. The info is displayed on the team or venue page.
* Added Spanish translation (thanks Cristian Carlucci).
* Bug fixed: teams that are 'real' were accidently shown in a dropdown on the Matches admin screen.
* Bug fixed: matches that have an empty venue caused a notice in the import.
* bug fixed: countdown shortcode was not fixed for the new UTC match times.
* Bug fixed: UTC times that passed the end of the day (0:00h) caused matches to be displayed on the wrong day in the matches overview (thanks Cristian).
* Bug fixed: match times in the schedules that ship with the plugin were not UTC.

= 2.0.1 =
* Bug fixed: teams that are not in a group caused a notice in the import.
* Hint added on the matches admin screen.

= 2.0.0 =
* Added or changed admin screens for teams, groups, match types and matches so they can be easily manipulated. This way the plugin is not limited to the European championship, but can also be used for other competitions, e.g. the English Premier League.
* Changed default language to English. This makes the plugin easier to translate.
* Changed layout of the Plugin Option admin screen. More options and better grouped.
* Fixed a problem for DB users that don't have `TRUNCATE` rights. (thanks Millvi)
* Plugin now supports WordPress installs with default permalinks settings.

* Bug fixed: prediction page for a user did not show the right points for a bonus question. (thanks Maly77)
* Bug fixed: User Selector Widget caused a notice on 404 pages.
* Added colorbox instead of fancybox for lightbox. Fancybox does not have a GPL-compatible license.

= 1.4.5 =
* Removed Highcharts library from the package on request from WordPress. The Highcharts library has a non-GPL-compatible license which violates WordPress plugin rules. If you want to keep using the charts you have to download the library yourself and enable the charts feature in the plugin option screen.

= 1.4.4 =
* New: list of email adresses of players in your pool available in the plugin User Admin screen. You can copy and paste it in an email to quickly mail your users (without the need of installing a mail plugin).
* New: if using leagues the ranking page now defaults to the league the user is in.
* Bug fixed: check if user is a player in the pool did not work correct for users that are added to the blog, but are not in a league.
* Refactored code for the widgets.

= 1.4.3 =
* Fixed a potential problem with magic quotes (wp_magic_quotes adds slashes regardless of your PHP setup).
* Performance update. Reduced number of database queries for a page request.
* New widget (bÃ¨ta): countdown to next match.
* Extra options for countdown shortcode (see help page for details).

= 1.4.2 =
* DateTime::createFromFormat requires PHP 5.3 or higher. I replaced those calls in the core classes with code that doesn't break on PHP version 5.2.
* New version of the Fancybox javascript library (2.0.6).
* New version of the Highcharts javascript library (2.2.4).
* Added two more layout options to the plugin options (favicon and apple-touch-icon).

= 1.4.1 =
* Some texts were lost in translation. I added them.
* New configuration options for a single 'lock time' for matches and bonus questions. If set, users have to finish all their predictions before this date and time.
* Plugin supports a maximum number of answers a user may select in a multiple choice question (checkbox). The check is only done client-side and requires a bit of javascript knowledge to use it. See top of pool.js file for usage. I recommend adding the javascript calls in a separate file, add them to your theme or use a plugin that helps adding custom javascript to your blog. (thanks srozemuller)
* Added Polish translation. (thanks Åukasz CiastoÅ)

= 1.4 =
* Translations (i18n) are working. Plugin contains en_GB translation for my Dutch version of the pool and a pot-file for users that want to make their own translation. See the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/football-pool/faq/">FAQ</a> for more information. (thanks dcollis)
* Bonus questions and user answers can now contain more than 200 characters.

= 1.2 =
* New shortcode [fp-ranking] in case you don't want to use the ranking page or widget, but only want to display the ranking in a post. For complete help on this and other shortcodes, see the new help page in the admin section.

* Bug fixed: a timezone problem in the display of match times. (Thanks Okoth1)
* Bug fixed: the admin screen for bonusquestions not displaying user answers.
* Bug fixed: user selector widget showed all blog users.

= 1.1.3 =
* Fix for the problem that - on a clean install - the default data for the pool was not loaded (matches, teams, etc.) in the database. (Thanks Okoth1)

= 1.1.2 =
